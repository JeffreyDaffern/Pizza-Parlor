				<p class="about">Here at Jeff's pizzeria we strive to serve a nitche in the community consisting of people that love soft crust pizza. Whether you like yours moist or soaked, this is the place to go for the best soft crust pizza. Our cooks never over-cook pizzas, never worry about getting an unedible black-charred mystery pizza again!

				<br><br>Jeff Daffern has been cooking undercooked pizzas for over 20 years. Just let him know how you want it, and you will get it. NO QUESTIONS ASKED! This is a judgement free zone.
